# Recipe App

This project is a React application created with Vite, allowing users to log in with the credentials 'john@mail.com' and 'changeme'. Authenticated users can add their own recipes and dynamically change the theme of the site. The recipe data is fetched from a fake API, and to run the project with the fake API, you can use the command `npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3002`.Feel free to explore the application using these demo credentials.
