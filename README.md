# Recipe App

This project is a React application created with Vite, allowing users to log in with the credentials 'john@email.com' and 'changeme'. Authenticated users can add their own recipes, and the recipe list is fetched from a custom JSON server. To set up and fetch recipe data, run the command `npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3002`. Feel free to explore the application using these demo credentials.
